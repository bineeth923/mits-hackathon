## Proposal

An automated digital service that will connect needful people to
blood donors using extremely accessible interfaces - Phone, SMS,
Mobile App and a web portal. It will be deployed as an extension 
to existing govt. The system will preserve privacy of donors as 
well as ensure availability to needful by providing the contact 
info only after verified connection.


Essentially we will eliminate middlemen to reduce corruption, 
inefficiency and inequality in the process. While keeping the 
system very easy to use ( Just send an SMS or a call ) and 
accessible irrespective of the userâ€™s technological exposure.
